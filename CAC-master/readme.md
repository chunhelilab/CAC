# Cancer Adipose Conversion model 
This is a matlab implementation of Cacner Adipose Conversion network. 
This network includes 189 parameters and 16 components.

# Search the params for Cancer Adipose Conversion model.
In Search_params, we provide our method to identify the parameters corresponding to multistable states.
Please run BFS_grid_params.m to search the paramters (about 30 minutes).
In Fig2, please run the main.m to obtain the Landscape reduction landscape in Figure 2A [1] (about 10 minutes).
In Fig3, please run the main.m to obtain the Landscape in different dimensions (about 15 minutes).
In Fig4, please run the main.m to obtain the landscape control results for the given parameters (about 10 hour).
